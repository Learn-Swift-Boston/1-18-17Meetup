# Jan 18, 2017 Meetup

This was our first ever Beginner Night. We talked about the benefits of Swift over Objective-C. This largely revolved around formatting and readability. We also discussed several good beginner books:
* [A Swift Kickstart](http://editorscut.com/Books/SwiftKickstart/bookPage.html)
* [Apple's Swift book](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)
* [Swift Apprentice](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/swift-apprentice)
* [iOS Apprentice](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/ios-apprentice)

We also built a small scale calculator app (in this repo). Please feel free to fork or clone the app and play around in the code. There are also some suggested enhancements:
* add the rest of the numbers
* add a minus button (and code out its functionality)
* add multiplication and division 
* remove the forced unwrapping in ```func equalTapped()```
